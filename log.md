# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: Feb 8, Weds

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Twitchtv project -FCC

**Thoughts** Was stuck on my calculator project and getting demotivated after a few days with no prgress, decided to keep going and started working on the Twitch tv project. Created basic page with html/css

### Day 2: 9th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: continued working on Twitchtv, making api call

**Thoughts** Slight confusion with making the call to api, I could see objects being returned if I put url in browser but couldn't get my function to work, read and searched but eventually used FCC gitter help channel to help me resolve.

### Day 2:update

**Today's Progress**: Got api call to work

**Thoughts** It's always the little things that get you. Minor errors were causing the function to fail, ie: url missing ```/``` after ```/user``` and not iterating through array as I forgot the ```[i]``` and to add JQuery scripts. 
Sometimes it's better to stop, leave it and/or ask for help, so you can see the problem with fresh eyes.
