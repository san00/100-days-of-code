# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: Feb 8, Weds

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Twitchtv project -FCC

**Thoughts** Was stuck on my calculator project and getting demotivated after a few days with no prgress, decided to keep going and started working on the Twitch tv project. Created basic page with html/css

### Day 2: 9th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: continued working on Twitchtv, making api call

**Thoughts** Slight confusion with making the call to api, I could see objects being returned if I put url in browser but couldn't get my function to work, read and searched but eventually used FCC gitter help channel to help me resolve.

### Day 2:update

**Today's Progress**: Got api call to work

**Thoughts** It's always the little things that get you. Minor errors were causing the function to fail, ie: url missing ```/``` after ```/user``` and not iterating through array as I forgot the ```[i]``` and to add JQuery scripts. Sometimes it's better to stop, leave it and/or ask for help, so you can see the problem with fresh eyes. 

### Day 3: 10th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: Displaying user info from api 

**Thoughts** The function still needs work, as it's currently only displaying info from one user, although finally got some data to display correctly on page. 
Forgot I had to use href's or src tags to view returned data correctly and struggled a bit before remembering this is what I had to do.

### Day 4: 11th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: Displaying user info and online status 

**Thoughts** Got function to display online/offline status and channel info from all user's. 
Took roughly 2-3 hrs, but it felt good to figure out a way to keep everything within a single function and get it to work. 
Happy that my understanding of concepts and ways of thinking about and using JS is improving. Felt good to put existing knowledge to the test.

The response in this post from user(marzelin) helped me understand what I was trying to do https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/twitch-api-unexplained-random-array-and-getstream-api-help/82046/9
