# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 1: Feb 8, Weds

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the Twitchtv project -FCC

**Thoughts** Was stuck on my calculator project and getting demotivated after a few days with no prgress, decided to keep going and started working on the Twitch tv project. Created basic page with html/css

### Day 2: 9th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: continued working on Twitchtv, making api call

**Thoughts** Slight confusion with making the call to api, I could see objects being returned if I put url in browser but couldn't get my function to work, read and searched but eventually used FCC gitter help channel to help me resolve.
Watch this space...

### Day 2:update

**Today's Progress**: Got api call to work

**Thoughts** It's always the little things that get you. Minor errors were causing the function to fail, ie: url missing ```/``` after ```/user``` and not iterating through array as I forgot the ```[i]``` and to add JQuery scripts. Sometimes it's better to stop, leave it and/or ask for help, so you can see the problem with fresh eyes. 

### Day 3: 10th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: Displaying user info from api 

**Thoughts** The function still needs work, as it's currently only displaying info from one user, although finally got some data to display correctly on page. 
Forgot I had to use href's or src tags to view returned data correctly and struggled a bit before remembering this is what I had to do.

### Day 4: 11th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: Displaying user info and online status 

**Thoughts** Got function to display online/offline status and channel info from all user's. 
Took roughly 2-3 hrs, but it felt good to figure out a way to keep everything within a single function and get it to work. 
Happy that my understanding of concepts and ways of thinking about and using JS is improving. Felt good to put existing knowledge to the test.

The response in this post from user(marzelin) helped me understand what I was trying to do https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/twitch-api-unexplained-random-array-and-getstream-api-help/82046/9

### Day 6: 12th Feb,

**Today's Progress**: Click link to user channel/Show placeholder if account closed or never existed

**Thoughts** Created the click link okay, although didn't get the placeholder to work. Checking the forum, it looks like it's due to changes with the twitch api.
Next steps, work on page design/layout & refactor code.

### Day 6:update

**Today's Progress**: Completed core functionality and page design

**Thoughts** Okay, so I did more than an hour today, which is not unusual and got the functionality and page design done. Need to view and test on other devices and finish some minor JS refactoring, but I'm happy to have finished with another project to show for my efforts, 
Onward & upward. :)

### Day 7: 13th,

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS calculator functionality.  

**Thoughts** Revisted my JS calc project and frustrated that I came no closer to figuring out how to chain the math functions until I hit equals. I know what to do in my head but so far haven't been able to get that into code. Arghhhhh. 

Searching and looking for examples didn't help either, as so many ways to do this, code can vary a lot. 
Was a bit deflated, but started looking at other projects I could do to keep building and design related inspiration to help with my project designs. 

I should go back and clean up the code for the twitch project but was eager to keep moving and figuring out how to do the calc function.

### Day 8: 14th,

**Today's Progress**: Code cleanup(TwitchTv) and created Git page. 

**Thoughts** Will finish cleanup tomorrow


### Day 9: 15th,

**Today's Progress**: Continued code cleanup and started looking at resources and potential node and react projects to build. 

**Thoughts** Improved Twitchtv code readability. Would still like to improve overall page design. Will come back to this.

### Day 11: 17th,

**Today's Progress**: FCC algo - Wherefore art thou & Pig latinâ€‰ 

**Thoughts** Struggled with both of these, got parts of Wherefore algo working, but need to better understand the hasOwnProperty() method & for Pig latin, got firts half but didn't quite manage a solution for moving consonants.
Sometimes progress feels really slow. Need to practice.(sign up to coding sites)

### Day 12: 20th,

**Today's Progress**: Started a React/electron project, continued some work on calculator.

**Thoughts** Frustrated by my lack of progress with the calculator project & algo's a few days ago, and slightly intimidated by the pomodoro project, I thought I'd try to learn about react instead. 

Started following a tutorial to create a music player and although it looked manageable, found that I'm having problems setting up & using electron and getting various errors in the terminal, some I don't know how to resolve.

Read various blogs & posts today that also helped to confused my thoughts about how to structure & continue my learning, as well as jumping from project to project which didn't help.
Made minimal progress with anything today and need to turn this around. 

Rant over.

### Day 13: 21st Feb,

**Today's Progress**: 
*	Completed some Codewars kata,
* Cont some work on calculator functionality,
* Cont React/electron project

**Thoughts** 
Had the most success today on codewars as I completed some kata. 
Worked on calculator project, although still couldn't quite figure chaining the math and also revisted the React project, but had issue's with electron, so will leave and revist React again in the future.

### Day 14: 22nd Feb,

**Today's Progress**: 
* Cont some work on calculator functionality,

**Thoughts** 
Got some help from a code coach today and was able to better understand the logic of chaining the math in the calculator project. Happy I was able to complete this and other functionality, as it feels like a weight has been lifted after struggling with it for what felt like an age. yay.

Next step design.
